\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This is a paper and note template for the LSST DESC \citep{Overview,ScienceBook,WhitePaper}.
Eventually it will be possible to switch between various \LaTeX\xspace styles for internal notes and peer reviewed journals templates.
The base switch is between \code{aastex.cls} and \code{revtex.cls}; however, facilities are also provided for \code{emulateapj.cls} and \code{mnras.cls}.\footnote{The \code{mnras.cls} class file is a bit odd...}
Documents can be compiled using the provided \code{Makefile} with several options: \code{make apj}, \code{make apjl}, \code{make prd}, and \code{make mnras}.
There are some oddities when changing between templates, so please be patient while we try to work these out.

\section{Commands}
\label{sec:commands}

There are a number of useful \LaTeX\xspace commands predefined in \code{macros.tex}.
Notice that the section labels are prefixed with \code{sec:} to allow the use of the \verb=\secref= command to reference a section (\ie, \secref{intro}).
Figures can be referenced with the \verb=\figref= command, which assumes that the figure label is prefixed with \code{fig:}.
In \figref{example} we show an example figure.
You'll notice that the actual figure file is found in the \code{figures} directory.
However, because we have specified this directory in our \verb=\graphicspath= we do not need to explicitly specify the path to the image.

The \code{macros.tex} package also contains some conventional scientific units like \angstrom, \GeV, \Msun, etc. and some editorial tools for highlighting \FIXME{issues}, \CHECK{text to be checked}, \COMMENT{comments}, and \NEW{new additions}.


\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

Similar to the figure before, here we have included a table of data from \code{tables/table.tex}.
Notice that again we are able to reference \tabref{example} with the \verb=\tabref= command using the \code{tab:} prefix.
Also notice that we haven't needed to specify the full path to the table because in the \code{Makefile} we include \code{./tables} directory in the \code{\$TEXINPUTS} environment variable.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

If you are planning on committing your paper to github, it's a good idea to write your tex as one sentence per line.
This allows for an easier \code{diff} of changes.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

And still not much.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In conclusion, there are no conclusions.
