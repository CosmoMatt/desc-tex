# start_paper

Use Cookiecutter to make a folder containing everything you need to start writing an LSST DESC paper (either a journal article or a Note). This follows Jonathan Sick's `lsst_technote_bootstrap` method, albeit with a simpler set-up.

## Why should I use this tool?
1. It'll save you some set-up time, which you can spend time writing about science instead. 
2. It'll help you comply with the LSST DESC Publication Policy, which places some requirements on papers to state the contributions of its authors.
3. It'll save you some writing time, by automagically writing the author list and acknowledgments, and getting the latex styling right,  for you.

## How do I use it?

You will need to install `cookiecutter`:
```
pip install cookiecutter
```
Then just do:
```
cookiecutter XXX
```
